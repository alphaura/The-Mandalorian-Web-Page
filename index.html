            <p class="colleft">In a galaxy far, far away, Din Djarin was a skilled bounty hunter known as "the Mandalorian." 
                He operated during the chaotic period after the fall of the Galactic Empire, and he had a strict 
                code of honor as a member of the Mandalorian culture. Djarin was physically imposing, standing tall 
                and wearing a suit of beskar armor that marked him as a formidable warrior. He carried a variety of 
                weapons and was feared by many.<br>
                <br>
                Despite his fearsome reputation, Mando was stoic and reserved,</p>
            
            <p class="colright"> preferring to let his actions speak for themselves. He was fiercely loyal to those he cared 
                about and would go to great lengths to protect them. Mando was also unwavering in his commitment to the Mandalorian 
                code, which set him apart from other bounty hunters and mercenaries in the galaxy. Despite his serious demeanor, 
                Mando occasionally showed a wry wit that belied his gruff exterior.</p>

            <p class="p1">Grogu, also known as Baby Yoda, possessed great power in the Force and became a cherished figure in the galaxy. 
                          The Mandalorian was tasked with protecting him, forming a close bond as they faced danger together.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                          His innocence and vulnerability served as a reminder of the importance of compassion and love amidst the turmoil 
                          of war and conflict. He became a symbol of hope, inspiring those around him to seek redemption and forge new paths 
                          forward.</p>
            <img src="img/bobafett.jpeg" alt="" class="img2">
            <p class="p2">Boba Fett was a legendary bounty hunter whose reputation preceded him throughout the galaxy. His sleek armor, 
                          advanced weaponry, and unyielding determination made him one of the most feared and respected individuals in 
                          the criminal underworld.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                          As a clone of the infamous Jango Fett, Boba inherited his father's combat skills and strategic mind, honing them 
                          to perfection in pursuit of his quarry. He became known for his resourcefulness, using every tool at his disposal 
                          to track down and capture his targets.</p>
            <img src="img/Caradune.jpeg" alt="" class="img3">
            <p class="p3">Cara Dune was a skilled warrior and former rebel shock trooper whose exploits in battle earned her a reputation as 
                          one of the toughest fighters in the galaxy. Her combat training and experience proved invaluable as she fought against 
                          the remnants of the Empire alongside the Mandalorian and other allies.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                          But Cara's strength and toughness belied a softer side. She had a deep sense of loyalty and a fierce protectiveness towards 
                          those she cared about, often putting herself in harm's way to defend them.</p>
            <img src="img/greefkarga.jpeg" alt="" class="img4">
            <p class="p4">Greef Karga was a charismatic leader and skilled operator of the bounty hunters' guild. His savvy negotiation skills and 
                          ability to maintain order within his organization made him a respected figure in the criminal underworld.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                          Despite his affiliation with unsavory characters, Greef possessed a strong moral compass and a desire to do what was right. 
                          He recognized the threat posed by the Empire and worked with the Mandalorian and other allies to fight against their oppressive 
                          rule.</p>

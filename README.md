# The-Mandalorian-Web-Page
 This is a webpage solely created using HTML and CSS, showcasing the character "The Mandalorian".

I started the project by designing a simple looking wireframes on a pieces of paper to later start looking at what type of banners and images I wanted to use. I wanted to keep it as much as possible connected to the series and story of the mandalorian itself, so took my time in getting and editing the banners I vibed with.

Once the images were sorted, I started working on recreating the wireframing design on Figma to have it more relevant of how the project will look like. I have used ChatGPT to write the text I used, and made sure that it kept the tone of Starwars to keep it consistent with the theme itself.

Once I was happy with how the Figma design was looking, I got in the trenches and started coding away. At the time of coding the first version of this project I didn't have the knowledge of how to use Flexbox and the mobile-first mindset, so I was experiencing some layout and positioning issues throughout the coding time as I was using the extracts I was getting from Figma and almost did position absolute and relative on everything and the second I resive the page, everything moves, which I didn't like.

This feeling triggered for more learning, which is when I enrolled myself in a 21 day challenge based mainly on responsive design. After finishing the course and also the final project, I decided to repurpose the content I used in version 1 of this project, to make version 2 better and responsive.

I started with making a new HTML index to improve the structuring of the code, and make it more understandable.
